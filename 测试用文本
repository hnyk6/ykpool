I want to go to Australia because it is a beautiful country.  It has a rich range of events and festivals to plan my holiday around. Visit for world-class events such as the Grand Prix, Australian Open tennis or the Melbourne Cup.

I will also head to high-profile sporting matches such as the Ashes, Bledisloe Cup or Australian Rules Football and immerse myself in the arts and music festivals that enliven the cities each summer. I will indulge in concerts, musicals, ballet, opera and theatre and join exuberant parties like Sydney��s NYE celebrations.

During summer, we can discover the surf lifesaving and surf carnivals along the coast. In winter, tackle a marathon or endurance event. Or travel to sacred Aboriginal festivals and madcap outback events such as the Camel Cup or Henley-on-Todd.

Australia��s events and festivals range from local events to world-famous celebrations and happen across all seasons and destinations. Wherever and whenever, I would defintely want to give this country a visit.
